;Web EC2;3;100;upgraded from t2.micro to t3.medium. Not really needed in standby group until needed, that is, scaling group kicks in. Left as is
;App EC2;3;191;upgraded from t2.micro to t3.large
;Multi-AZ DB;1;13412;upgraded from db.m1.large to db.m4.4xlarge + storage increased from 20 to 40 TB

;;;1. let's add a NAT GW to each AZ.;
;;;2. setup DB as a Multi-AZ DB, increase capacity of DB server and storage for better performance and more robust solution;
;;;3. increase performance of EC2 instances my selecting better performing compute instances, web: t2.micro to t3.medium, app  t2.micro to t3.large;
;;;4. set-up whole standby region with two AZ and 4 subnets as before. Add web server, app servers and a read replica DB.;
;;;5. add S3 Cross-Region Replication to new region;
